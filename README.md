# Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard
Homework Challenge #6




## Project Description

<!-- For this assignment we had to create a weather dashboard. We had to make sure that when first opening the applcation the current weather shows, and the next five days and 3-hourly weather shows. In those cards, the current city, weather condition with icon, humidity, wind speed, and date are in them. When the user searches for a weather in a city it will automatically display what I had just mentioned. For the date I used the moment.js code where it shows the date, year, day of the week, and the time. The user can either search using the city or city, state code, and country code. When the user clicks on a history city of their search it will take them back to that search and show the weather. When the user searches for the same city it won't appear again. The city also persists after they click refresh. I had also added a "clear history" button just in case the user wants to start fresh. The background also changes according to what the weather conditions is.  In the cards I had also added additional weather conditions just in case the user likes to get more indepth information on the weather. My live page can be seen in the <a href="#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</a> section. HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js are all used on this application. It is also responsive to all devices: laptop,tablets, and mobile.

## Installation

Installation is not required, unless you plan on cloning to refactor the code. Please <a href="mailto:hannahkchung88@gmail.com">email me</a> to make sure this is okay. 

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## How to Use the Project and Acceptance Criteria
<u><i><strong>Click on the image below</strong></i></u></a> 
<a href= "https://hannybear88.github.io/Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard"><img src="./assets/images/Weather-Dashboard-Icon-and-Title.png" alt = "direct link to deployed application" /></a>
to be directed straight to the deployed application

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

<!-- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<img src="./assets/images/Weather-Dashboard-Icon-and-Title.png" /> -->

<!-- WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
<img src="./assets/images/Work-Day-Timeblocks-Shown.png" />


WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<img src="./assets/images/Color-Coded-Past-Present-Future.png" />

Past = GRAY
<img src="./assets/images/Work-Day-Schedule-Past.png" />

present = RED
<img src="./assets/images/Work-Day-Schedule-Present.png" />

Future = GREEN
<img src="./assets/images/Work-Day-Schedule-Future.png" />

WHEN I click into a time block
<img src="./assets/images/User-Clicks-on-Timeblock.png" />

THEN I can enter an event
<img src="./assets/images/User-Enters-Schedule-in-Timeblock.png" />
<img src="./assets/images/User-Entered-Schedule-in-Timeblock.png" />

WHEN I click the save button for that time block
<img src="./assets/images/User-Clicks-Save-to-Save-Their-Schedule-of-the-Day.png" />

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<img src="./assets/images/User-Saves-Their-Schedule-of-Their-Day.png" /> 


WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
<img src="./assets/images/User-Schedule-of-Their-Day-Saves-Persists-After-Refresh.png" />
<img src="./assets/images/Schedule-Persists-After-Clicking-Refresh.gif"/> -->

## Challenges
<!-- This assignment was a challenging by figuring out how to fetch the api. Even though this assignment was challenging, it was quite enjoyable because I do like knowing what the weather is like especially on days I have plans where would be takrn plsvr outside most of the day if not all day. It is also very useful to know the weather in advance, so I am prepared to drive in a weather other than the weather conditions being sunny and clear. It also helps me how I should dress up and if I need to bring extra clothes depending on the weather. I'd like to eventually challenge myself on this project by adding an option of having a section where it leads to a planner and jot down notes according to the weather. 

I wanted to add the UV Index in the cards, however, unfortunately it isn't available for free anymore. 
<!-- I had also wanted to add the weather snow conditions, but I  -->

## Success
I feel like I did well on this assignment by suceeding on the requirements on the assignment. I had added extra features to challenge myself which I like to do. I had added the extra weather conditions, so the user knows what to expect such as the chance of rain and what the lowest & highest temperature would be for the next 5 days and 3-hourly forecast so they can be prepared what the weather would be like in advance.
